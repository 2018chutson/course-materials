You might need to do a "go mod init bhg-scanner" or "go mod tidy"

Updates to code:

The code creates two channels, one for the ports and one for the results
of the open/closed check on the ports. DialTimeout attempts to connect to each
port, then returns an error if there was an error (or it timed out). If there
was an error, 0 is piped into results, otherwise, the port number is piped into
results. Then, another function checks the output of results, and if it's a 0,
the port is added to closedports, otherwise, the port is added to open ports. 
The function sorts the open ports list, then prints them, and prints the
number of closed ports as well. The function returns the number of both open and
closed ports, which should be the length of the original test set.

I added taking a slice of port numbers to check, rather than scanning a
range of ports. Useful if you need to check a few specific ports. I also 
modified the print output to print the open ports and then just print the
number of closed ports left over. I also added a check to see if the World of
Warcraft port is open, and a corresponding message for whether the user is
currently playing WoW or not (it's my partner's favorite game). :)
